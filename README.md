# Dockerized Cloudmapper

[Cloudmapper](https://github.com/duo-labs/cloudmapper) is a tool to visualize AWS infrastructure.  In early July 2018, [Docker support was
removed](https://github.com/duo-labs/cloudmapper/commit/c430e5faab41e8355052e82fe9dea4d8f4beb654) from their repo.  I wrote this project to bring back support for Docker.

I personally find that running this application is docker is easier because it avoids issues with dependency version conflicts.  Running it in Docker "Just Works™" and keeps my host machine nice and clean.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites: just `Docker` :)

- `git clone https://github.com/sebastientaggart/docker-cloudmapper.git`
- `cd docker-cloudmapper`
- Edit `.env` file and add your AWS key, secret, region, and account name.
- `docker-compose build` (go get a cup of coffee)
- `docker-compose up prepare` (wait until preparing webserver)
- `docker-compose up web -d`

Go to http://localhost:8000 and enjoy!

Stop the service with `docker-compose down`.  Back up with `docker-compose up -d`.  View logs with `docker-compose logs -f`.  Do a rebuild with `docker-compose build`, or `docker-compose build --no-cache` if something went wrong.

### Logging into the Container

Once the service is running you can log into the container with `docker exec -it cloudmapper sh`.  You will automatically be put into `/opt/cloudmapper`, from which all the usual Cloudmapper commands will run.  Note that `$ACCOUNT` and other variables are already set for you in the container, so these command will Just Work™

- `pipenv run python cloudmapper.py collect --account $ACCOUNT` Collect info about our AWS infrastructure
- `pipenv run python cloudmapper.py prepare --account $ACCOUNT` Prepare the collected data for serving

## How This Works / Approach

This project starts with a `Dockerfile` (loosely based on the original dockerfile from the Cloudmapper project), based on `python:alpine` and built via `docker-compose build`, which does the following:

1. Install necessary packages, e.g. `git`
2. Clone cloudmapper.git and enable pipenv
3. Install awscli
4. Copy the `entrypoint.sh` and `.env` files into the container
5. Run `entrypoint.sh`, which
    1. `source`'s `.env`
    2. Configures AWS CLI with the variables from `.env`
    3. Run `[...] cloudmapper.py configure [...]`, `collect`, and `prepare` commands with variables from `.env`
    4. Serve the generated site on `:8000` (assuming you didn't change this in `.env`)

Next, we execute `docker-compose up -d`...

1. Call the image we build `cloudmapper`
2. Call the container `cloudmapper`
3. `env_file: .env` negates the need to `source` it in `Dockerfile`, but we do it anyway here in anticipation of the "Further Improvements" (see below)
4. Volume our data:
    - `./account-data` stores the json files that are generated during `collect`.
    - `./web` stores the generated web files that display the visualization generated by Cloudmapper
5. Set the external port based on the value in `.env` (for convenience, and to limit the number of files necessary to configure)

### Debugging Reference

If you want to help contribute and/or debug, and you're new to Docker, these might save you some time:

Build without docker-compose:
`docker build --pull --tag cloudmapper .`
`docker build --tag cloudmapper .` (without force pulling base container)

Problems with the build?  Debug and force a rebuild with no-cache:
`docker build --no-cache --tag cloudmapper .`

Add `CMD tail -f /dev/null` to the `Dockerfile` to keep it alive, disable `entrypoint.sh`

## Further Improvements

Instead of automatically running Cloudmapper `collect`, `prepare`, and `webserver`, we should instead have a container that runs these commands externally for more flexibility.  The approach would then be to run something like `docker exec cloudmapper collect --account FOO`.  This way, we could add another account, for example, and regenerate the visualization as needed, etc.  We would still want a simple "quick start" approach that would get people up and running in just a few steps.  Note that this is possible now, with `docker exec -it cloudmapper sh` and running any commands you want.

The current approach also assumes that you only need to run `collect` and `prepare` once (on container build).  This is not practical in all situations, and the current solution, `docker-compose build --no-cache` (a forced rebuild from scratch) is not an efficient solution.  Building the container as described above will mitigate this problem.

Another improvement would be to serve `/web` via nginx instead of the built-in `cloudmapper.py webserver` to improve performance, and because it's "best practice", but I did not see a real-world, measurable improvement in performance.  We would add nginx to docker-compose.yml for this.

"Debug Mode" is not yet working in this build.  I added the variables for it, and the code is ready, but I don't personally have any need for demo data, so I didn't finish setting it up.
